## Features

- Integrate into any web-based application.
- Annotate images with classifications, tags, bounding boxes, polygons, points and more
- Annotate NLP datasets with Named Entity Recognition (NER), classification and Part of Speech (PoS) tagging.
- Perform data entry

## Principles

- Correctness of implementation of the .udt.json standard.
- Implement entirety of the Open Human Annotation standard.
- Rely on external libraries which specialize in each type of annotation to enable the best tools to be used
- Easy to use
- Easy to integrate

## Libraries

The Universal Data Tool is always looking for the best libraries to provide the
user interface for different types of annotation. Currently, the following
libraries are used...

- [material-survey](https://github.com/collegeai/material-survey) for data entry.
- [react-image-annotate](https://github.com/workaroundonline/react-image-annotate) for image annotation.
- [react-nlp-annotate](https://github.com/workaroundonline/react-nlp-annotate) for entity recognition and NLP tasks.
